        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This oxtail kare kare is a richly flavored stew thanks to slow-simmered oxtail. The oxtail can be cooked a day ahead, so you can skim off the fat to make the dish a little healthier. Using a pressure cooker will reduce the cooking time, but the stew won't be as flavorful. Serve with rice and bagoóng (shrimp paste).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ½ pounds beef oxtails</li>
            <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
            <li>½ pound bok choy, chopped</li>
            <li>½ pound long beans, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>½ pound eggplant, cubed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon achiote powder</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring oxtails and water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, at least 2 hours, adding more water as necessary. Skim as much fat from the top of the liquid as possible.</li>
            <li>Transfer oxtails to a plate. Crumble beef bouillon cubes into the pot and stir to dissolve. Add bok choy, beans, and eggplant and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
